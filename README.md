## 🧻 What in the actual flush is this?

**Pooptastic™** is the most majestic, absurd, and pointlessly brilliant JavaScript package to ever grace the bowl of software development.

It does:

* Nothing productive ✅
* Everything childish ✅
* Unmatched commitment to crap ✅✅✅

Use it in your production app. Or don’t.
**Use it in your bathroom. Definitely.**

---

## 🚽 Installation

```bash
npm install pooptastic
```

It installs faster than bad sushi goes through your intestines.

## 💩 Features So Good They’re Criminally Constipated

| Feature              | Description                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isPoop()`           | Returns true if input is poop. False if you're lying to yourself.      |
| `flushPoop()`        | Removes all evidence. Emotionally satisfying. May cause splashback.    |
| `ratePoop()`         | Poop reviews by our AI turd critic. Michelin Star not included.        |
| `generatePoopName()` | Instantly rebrands you as “Baron Von Buttcheeks” or “Sir Plops-a-Lot.” |
| `getPoopFortune()`   | Like a fortune cookie, but stinkier and far more honest.               |
| `poopChain()`        | A blockchain made entirely of 💩. Completely unverified.               |
| `dumpHeap()`         | Deletes your hopes and dreams. And some code.                          |
| `lintWipe()`         | Lints code with moist towelette precision.                             |
| `autoGrunt()`        | Adds ambient grunting for full immersion.                              |
| `fiberBoost()`       | Makes loops more regular. And poopier.                                 |

## 🧪 Sample Dump

```js
const poop = require('pooptastic');

console.log(poop.isPoop('💩'));  
// true

console.log(poop.ratePoop());  
// "9/10 — started with flair, ended with a fart."

console.log(poop.getPoopFortune());  
// "You will soon face a deeply emotional flush."

poop.flushPoop();  
// 💨 SWOOOOOSH 💦
```

* Install on a coworker’s project during lunch
* Build an app called **CRUD** that’s literal
* Replace your linter with `lintWipe()` and watch the chaos

## 🪠 Poop Puns & Non-Toilet Nonsense

* Our code is **cleaner than a bidet on turbo mode**
* Uses zero toilet paper: we're an **eco-shart package**
* Runs like a dream. **A wet one.**
* Smells like **teen spirit and refried regret**
* Now with less kernel panic, more **cornel panic**

**Bonus command:**

```

## 🦄 Non-Toilet Randomness for Maximum WTF

* `poop.summonBathroomWizard()` – Grants you +3 flush speed.
* `poop.unlockForbiddenStall()` – The one with the good lighting.
* `poop.invokeToiletGod()` – "You rang?"
* `poop.teleportToGasStationRestroom()` – Not recommended.
* `poop.generatePoopNFT()` – Not stored on the blockchain, stored in your shame.
